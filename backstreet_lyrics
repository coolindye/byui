Huh
Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

[Chorus:]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
Cuz all of your time spent keeps us alive

[Chorus]

All of your time spent keeps us alive

[Chorus]

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life

[Chorus]
Yeah...

[Brian:]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

[Nick:]
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[AJ:]
Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Kevin:]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...

[Howie:]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are
You are, you are, you are

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

'Cause I want it that way
Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

[2x]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)

I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
Mmm, you really make me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed (uh huh, uh huh)

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

[Chorus:]
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you

Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz baby I see only you, oh yeah

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

[Chorus]

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

And you know
I can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz of you, yeah...
It's gotta be you, all the way
All that I ever wanted
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you

[Chorus]
Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

I figured out what to say to you
But sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong, always they do
And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more
And baby I know
I need you
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you, oh

I need you tonight (I need you, oh I need you baby)
I need you right now (It's gotta be this, it's gotta be this)
I know deep within my heart
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you tonight
Don't, don't want you back

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

[Chorus:]
Don't want you back
Cuz you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize, realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

[Chorus]

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know (don't want you back, don't want you back)
All I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go

[Chorus (2x)]
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

[Chorus:]
Don't wanna lose you now
Baby I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to live that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

[Chorus]

I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you

Don't wanna lose to loneliness
Girl I know we can win
Don't wanna lose to emptiness, oh no
Never again

[Chorus]
I'll be the one

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

There you are, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus:]
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my faith is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you are, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus]

To hold you, and make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, baby please...

I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run

[Chorus]

I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one

To hold you, and make sure that you'll be alright
I'll be the one
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

[Chorus:]
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
Cuz your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And made you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only you would tell me girl

[Chorus]

Give me one more chance, to give my love to you
Cuz no one on this earth loves you like I do
Tell me...

[Chorus]

I turn back time
To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
I beg and plead
Fall to my knees
To find a way back to your heart
Here we are
In the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right
For us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus:]
It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart
And in my mind
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus]

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus]
When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch, come between the two of us

Cuz no one else will ever take your place

[Chorus:]
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, cuz in my eyes

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

[Chorus:]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cuz mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

[Chorus]

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

[Chorus]

Cuz mom you always were,
Mom you always were
Mom you always were,
You know you always were
Cuz mom you always were... the perfect fan

I love you Mom
